@inproceedings{Brown2004,
abstract = {This paper describes an implementation of a wireless mobile ad hoc network with radio nodes mounted at fixed sites, on ground vehicles, and in small (10kg) UAVs. The ad hoc networking allows any two nodes to communicate either directly or through an arbitrary number of other nodes which act as relays. We envision two scenarios for this type of network. In the first, the UAV acts as a prominent radio node that connects disconnected ground radios. In the second, the networking enables groups of UAVs to communicate with each other to extend small UAVs' operational scope and range. The network consists of mesh network radios assembled from low-cost commercial off the shelf components. The radio is an IEEE 802.11b (WiFi) wireless interface and is controlled by an embedded computer. The network protocol is an implementation of the Dynamic Source Routing ad hoc networking protocol. The radio is mounted either in an environmental enclosure for outdoor fixed and vehicle mounting or directly in our custom built UAVs. A monitoring architecture has been embedded into the radios for detailed performance characterization and analysis. This paper describes these components and performance results measured at an outdoor test range.},

abstract = {We present an approach to developing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarming behaviors and command and control (C2) strategies to govern them. In recent years, the military has become increasingly interested in the development and applications of UAVs. Recent attention has shifted toward designing UAVs which are not only unmanned, but also autonomous or self-controlled. One possible method is to utilize a large number of small, autonomous UAVs which form a cohesive group or “swarm” to accomplish complex missions as a whole. Swarms offer numerous benefits over single UAVs which include higher coverage, redundancy in numbers and reduced long-range bandwidth requirements. A major challenge to engineering a swarm is not only designing the swarming behavior, but finding an effective way to control the behavior so that the swarm can be directed to complete the desired mission. In this paper, we used the agent-based modeling toolkit NetLogo to create two different mission types. We then created UAV swarming behaviors and ways in which those behaviors can be altered to accomplish each mission. Despite the fact that these models are still preliminary, and lacking in full realism, this work has demonstrated the potential usefulness of agent-based modeling in the engineering of UAV swarms.},

@article{Mammadova,
abstract = {The communication range between a civilian Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and a Ground Control Station (GCS) is affected by the government regulations that determine the use of frequency bands and constrain the amount of power in those frequencies. The application of multiple UAVs in search and rescue operations for example demands a reliable, long-range inter-UAV communication. The inter-UAV communication is the ability of UAVs to exchange data among themselves, thus forming a network in the air. This ability could be used to extend the range of communication by using a decentralized routing technique in the network. To provide this ability to a fleet of autonomous dirigible UAVs being developed at the University of Ottawa, a new communication framework was introduced and implemented. Providing a true mesh networking based on a novel routing protocol, the framework combines long-range radios at 900 MHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band with the software integrated into the electronics platform of each dirigible. With one radio module per dirigible the implemented software provides core functionalities to each UAV, such as exchanging flight control commands, telemetry data, and photos with any other UAV in a decentralized network or with the GCS. We made use of the advanced networking tools of the radio modules to build capabilities into the software for route tracing, traffic prioritization, and minimizing self-interference. Initial test results showed that without acknowledgements, packets can be received in the wrong order and cause errors in the transmission of photos. In addition, a transmission in a presence of a third broadcasting node slows down by 4-6 times. Based on these results our software was improved to control to flow of transmit data making the fragmentation, packetization, and reassembly of photos more reliable. Currently, using radios with half-wavelength dipole antennas we can achieve a one-hop communication range of up to 5 km with the radio frequency line-of-sight (RF LOS). This can be extended further by adding as many radio nodes as needed to act as intermediate hops. ii Acknowledgements},

@article{He2018,
abstract = {UAV swarm is a typical application of multi-agent system and consists of a certain number of single- or multi-function UAVs. This paper mainly focuses on the motion consensus and formation control of UAV swarm. A novel formation control algorithm suitable for both leaders and followers is designed, in which leaders are implicitly integrated into the swarm and can be influenced by navigational feedback from their flockmates. Theoretical analysis shows that the system is asymptotically stable and can converge to the desired formation without collision among vehicles. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the theoretical results and verify the velocity and trajectory tracking abilities of the algorithm. Results reveal that the proposed algorithm guarantees a swarm of UAVs to fly with predefined formation and track scheduled trajectory. Furthermore, the novel algorithm can reduce the communication consumption and enhance the adaptability and scalability of the system.},

abstract = {Nowadays, mini-drones, officially called unmanned aerial vehicles, are widely used in many military and civilian fields. Compared to traditional ad hoc networks, the mobile ad hoc networks established by UAVs are more efficient in completing complex tasks in harsh environments. However, due to the unique characteristics of UAVs (e.g., high mobility and sparse deployment), existing protocols or algorithms cannot be directly used for UAVs. In this article, we focus on the routes designed for UAVs, and aim to present a somewhat complete survey of the routing protocols. Moreover, the performance of existing routing protocols is compared in detail, which naturally leads to a great number of open research problems that are outlined afterward.},

@article{Bekmezci2013a,
abstract = {One of the most important design problems for multi-UAV (Unmanned Air Vehicle) systems is the communication which is crucial for cooperation and collaboration between the UAVs. If all UAVs are directly connected to an infrastructure, such as a ground base or a satellite, the communication between UAVs can be realized through the in-frastructure. However, this infrastructure based communication architecture restricts the capabilities of the multi-UAV systems. Ad-hoc networking between UAVs can solve the problems arising from a fully infrastructure based UAV networks. In this paper, Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANETs) are surveyed which is an ad hoc network connecting the UAVs. The differences between FANETs, MANETs (Mobile Ad-hoc Networks) and VANETs (Vehicle Ad-Hoc Networks) are clarified first, and then the main FANET design challenges are introduced. Along with the existing FANET protocols, open research issues are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Keywords: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) Routing Delay-tolerant networks (DTNs) A B S T R A C T Many advancements have been taking place in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology lately. This is leading towards the design and development of UAVs with various sizes that possess increased on-board processing, memory, storage, and communication capabilities. Consequently, UAVs are increasingly being used in a vast amount of commercial, military, civilian, agricultural, and environmental applications. However, to take full advantages of their services, these UAVs must be able to communicate efficiently with each other using UAV-to-UAV (U2U) communication and with existing networking infrastructures using UAV-to-Infrastructure (U2I) communication. In this paper, we identify the functions, services and requirements of UAV-based commu-nication systems. We also present networking architectures, underlying frameworks, and data traffic require-ments in these systems as well as outline the various protocols and technologies that can be used at different UAV communication links and networking layers. In addition, the paper discusses middleware layer services that can be provided in order to provide seamless communication and support heterogeneous network interfaces. Furthermore, we discuss a new important area of research, which involves the use of UAVs in collecting data from wireless sensor networks (WSNs). We discuss and evaluate several approaches that can be used to collect data from different types of WSNs including topologies such as linear sensor networks (LSNs), geometric and clustered WSNs. We outline the benefits of using UAVs for this function, which include significantly decreasing sensor node energy consumption, lower interference, and offers considerably increased flexibility in controlling the density of the deployed nodes since the need for the multihop approach for sensor-to-sink communication is either eliminated or significantly reduced. Consequently, UAVs can provide good connectivity to WSN clusters.},
