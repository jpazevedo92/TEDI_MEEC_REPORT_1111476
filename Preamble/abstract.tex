The maintenance of unmanned aerial vehicles, commonly called UAV, depends on the remote control. The scope of operation is limited by the success of radio communications between the controller and the UAV. In order to expand this range the UAVs networks or swarms can be used in order to define a mesh so that control commands can be routed to more distant units.

Due to the natural and artificial obstacles that exist in our environment or intentional interference, communication between the drones is susceptible to interruptions. In this sense is necessary to create solutions that optimize the communication avoiding as far as possible the interruptions that can occur due to those obstacles.

Throughout this thesis it is proposed a specification, development and testing of an overlay protocol to route controller instructions to command a remote UAV on a multi-hop basis.\newline
