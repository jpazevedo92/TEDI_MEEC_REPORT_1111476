The maintenance of unmanned aerial vehicles, called UAV, depends on the remote control. The scope of operation is limited by the success of radio communications between the controller and the UAV. In order to expand this range, networks or swarms of UAVs may be used in order to define a mesh so that control commands can be routed to more distant units.

Due to the natural and artificial obstacles that exist in our environment or due to intentional interference, communication between the drones is susceptible to interruptions and in this sense, it is necessary to create solutions that optimize the communication avoiding to the maximum the interruptions that may occur due to obstacles.

Throughout this thesis it is proposed a specification, development and testing of an overlay protocol to route controller instructions to command a remote UAV on a multi-hop basis.\newline
